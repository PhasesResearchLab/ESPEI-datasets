@article{Zhou2007,
abstract = {The phase equilibria associated with the binary Cu-Mg system are analyzed by applying results from first-principles calculations to a general solution thermodynamics treatment. Differing from previously reported models, we employ a four-species association model for the liquid, while the terminal and intermediate solid phases are modeled as substitutional solutions with one or two sublattices, respectively. The zero-Kelvin enthalpies of formation for the intermediate compounds, CU2Mg-C15 (cF24) and CuMg2-C-b (oF48) are computed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). The Gibbs free energy functions for the individual phases are evaluated, and the resulting binary phase diagram is presented over the full composition range. While the phase diagram we propose exhibits only modest deviation from previously reported models of phase equilibria, our treatment provides better agreement with experimental reports of heat capacity and enthalpy of mixing, indicating a more self-consistent thermodynamic description of this binary system.},

abstract = {Titanium alloys are highly sought after due to their excellent mechanical properties. One of the most commonly used Ti alloys is Ti-6Al-4V, which contains 6{\%} Al and 4{\%} V by weight. Despite the popularity of this alloy, no thermodynamic description of the ternary Al-Ti-V system has been published in the open literature. In this work an assessment procedure of the ternary Al-Ti-V system was initiated based on the binary descriptions by Witusiewitcz et al. (J. Alloys Compds. 465 (2008) 64-77 [1]) for (Al-Ti), Gong et al. (Int. J. Mater. Res. 95 (2004) 978-986 [2]) for (Al-V) and Saunders (COST 507, 2 (1998) 297-298 [3]) for (Ti-V). When combining the three binary systems and looking at the extrapolated ternary isothermal sections, it was found that there was a very large miscibility gap in the bcc phase. The origin of this miscibility gap was mainly the Al-V system and therefore it was decided to reassess this system. The Al-V system was reassessed according to available experimental data along with the enthalpies of formation of all compounds as well as the enthalpies of mixing for all terminal phases obtained by first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory. For the Al{\textless}inf{\textgreater}8{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}V{\textless}inf{\textgreater}5{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} phase there are two different sets of data for the enthalpies of formation. These two sets are investigated in this work and it is found that the set not used by Gong et al. in their assessment of the Al-V binary system gives better extrapolations. The final description produced improved extrapolated ternary isothermal sections.},

abstract = {Phase equilibria in ternary Ti-Fe-Cr system at 873 and 1173 K were investigated in this work. Based on the phase constitutions and phase compositions in 32 samples prepared using the equilibrated alloys, the isothermal sections of the Ti-Fe-Cr ternary system were established. For this system, there were six three-phase regions at both 873 and 1173 K, the phase relations at the studied two temperatures are almost the same. Thereinto, two tentative three-phase regions of $\beta$Cr2Ti + $\beta$(Ti) + (Fe, Cr)2Ti and $\beta$Cr2Ti + $\beta$(Ti) + $\alpha$Cr2Ti were deduced near the Ti-Cr side at 1173 K. The (Fe, Cr)2Ti phase has a large solubility of Cr, up to 59.1 at{\%} at 873 K and 59.5 at{\%} at 1173 K. Moreover, at 873 and 1173 K, the homogeneity ranges of the nearly linear ternary compounds $\tau$1were measured to be 49.9–72.1 at{\%} Fe and 52.7–77.2 at{\%} Fe, respectively, and the solubility of Cr in (Fe, Cr)Ti were 9.0 at{\%} and 10.6 at{\%}.},

abstract = {In this paper, more accurate phase limits of the NiCr phase diagram for the alloy composition near to Ni2Cr are presented and new information about the phase transformations of NiCr alloys is given. The phase boundary of the terminal nickel-rich solid solution was determined for temperatures from 550 to 1000 °C. Two different limiting curves related to the Ni2Cr superstructure were found. The limit below which this superstructure forms is placed 37 °C below the limit above which it decomposes. The existence of two structure morphologies of the Ni2Cr superstructure is indicated. The phase transformations of the nickel-rich solid solution in the region examined are markedly strain dependent. After quenching from high temperatures and heating at temperatures below about 500 °C has taken place, a supersaturated metastable solid solution exists in which the Ni2Cr superstructure forms. In the deformed material the precipitation of the chromium-rich phase precedes or accompanies the formation of the Ni2Cr superstructure. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

The system has been modeled thermodynamically previously, but there is no detailed description of its assessment available. In addition the enthalpy of mixing of the liquid has been measured a few times with quite different results since the previous assessments. In this paper a detailed thermodynamic assessment of the Cr–Ni system is presented. The system is described very satisfactorily with a small number of parameters. In contrast to most assessment papers also the assessment procedure is described in detail, including the optimization of the parameters using the PARROT module in Thermo-Calc. Extensive material is provided as supplementary material. The hope is that this can be of some use for young researchers just starting with Calphad type modeling.},

Impurity diffusion coefficients are also extracted using the forward-simulation method and are compared with data reported in the literature. The good agreement between data obtained from the current study and those reported in the literature serves as a validation of the forward-simulation method in extracting both interdiffusion and impurity diffusion coefficients. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Zhou2007,
abstract = {The phase equilibria associated with the binary Cu-Mg system are analyzed by applying results from first-principles calculations to a general solution thermodynamics treatment. Differing from previously reported models, we employ a four-species association model for the liquid, while the terminal and intermediate solid phases are modeled as substitutional solutions with one or two sublattices, respectively. The zero-Kelvin enthalpies of formation for the intermediate compounds, CU2Mg-C15 (cF24) and CuMg2-C-b (oF48) are computed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). The Gibbs free energy functions for the individual phases are evaluated, and the resulting binary phase diagram is presented over the full composition range. While the phase diagram we propose exhibits only modest deviation from previously reported models of phase equilibria, our treatment provides better agreement with experimental reports of heat capacity and enthalpy of mixing, indicating a more self-consistent thermodynamic description of this binary system.},

@article{Lindahl2015,
abstract = {Titanium alloys are highly sought after due to their excellent mechanical properties. One of the most commonly used Ti alloys is Ti-6Al-4V, which contains 6{\%} Al and 4{\%} V by weight. Despite the popularity of this alloy, no thermodynamic description of the ternary Al-Ti-V system has been published in the open literature. In this work an assessment procedure of the ternary Al-Ti-V system was initiated based on the binary descriptions by Witusiewitcz et al. (J. Alloys Compds. 465 (2008) 64-77 [1]) for (Al-Ti), Gong et al. (Int. J. Mater. Res. 95 (2004) 978-986 [2]) for (Al-V) and Saunders (COST 507, 2 (1998) 297-298 [3]) for (Ti-V). When combining the three binary systems and looking at the extrapolated ternary isothermal sections, it was found that there was a very large miscibility gap in the bcc phase. The origin of this miscibility gap was mainly the Al-V system and therefore it was decided to reassess this system. The Al-V system was reassessed according to available experimental data along with the enthalpies of formation of all compounds as well as the enthalpies of mixing for all terminal phases obtained by first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory. For the Al{\textless}inf{\textgreater}8{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}V{\textless}inf{\textgreater}5{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} phase there are two different sets of data for the enthalpies of formation. These two sets are investigated in this work and it is found that the set not used by Gong et al. in their assessment of the Al-V binary system gives better extrapolations. The final description produced improved extrapolated ternary isothermal sections.},

abstract = {Binary alloys of titanium with silver, lead, tin, nickel, copper, beryllium, boron, silicon, chromium, molybdenum, manganese, vanadium, iron, and cobalt were studied. One-half-pound ingots of the alloys were prepared in an arc furnace, employing a water-cooled copper crucible, an argon atmosphere, and a water-cooled tungsten electrode. The half-pound ingots were fabricated by forging at 1700°F in air to 1/4-in. slab, followed by hot rolling at 1450°F to 0.060-in. sheet. Tensile properties, minimum bend radii, hardnesses, response to heat treatment and aging treatment, and phase relationships were determined for these alloys.},
